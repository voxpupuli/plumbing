# Steven Pritchard (silug)

Hi, I'm Steven Pritchard. I'm currently the Head of Engineering at [Sicura](https://www.sicura.us/) and the lead developer for the [SIMP](https://simp-project.com/) open source project.

I've been working with Puppet for about a decade in both enterprise and open source environments, including time spent as a Puppet Professional Services Engineer (PSE). Seeing how Puppet is deployed in the real world as a PSE really shaped how I approach development today, especially on SIMP and within the ecosystem.

I've been active with Vox Pupuli since 2022, mostly contributing PRs and reviewing code. I'm a big believer in the community model here and want to help keep it running smoothly.

Right now, my main goal is delivering an OpenVox 9 release as soon as possible, with minimal disruption for users. As a PMC member, I'd bring that same pragmatic, user-first mindset to the decisions we need to make moving forward.
