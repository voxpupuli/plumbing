## About me

My name is Robert Waffen. I’m a German Automation Engineer at [betadots](https://github.com/betadots). I build and maintain infrastructure for customers and for myself, mostly around OpenVox and Puppet. I also enjoy writing Ruby and tinkering with container builds, steadily improving the OpenVox containers one commit at a time. In my free time, I play video games, devour sci-fi, and read manga and comics.

## My experience with Puppet

I first came into contact with Puppet in 2011. At that time, I was mainly a user deploying pre-written code. But as it often happens, the code sometimes failed or behaved in unexpected ways. That forced me to really understand what “this Puppet thing” was actually doing.

The next stage after simply using it was debugging code written by others. From there, I started writing my own modules and contributed to an OpenNebula module on GitHub. Step by step, my involvement grew: submitting my first pull requests to other projects, writing tests, setting up Puppet servers, upgrading entire infrastructures from one version to another, and diving deep into performance optimization.

## My experience with Vox Pupuli

Right after I started open-sourcing code, I discovered something surprising: GitHub was full of Puppet modules that didn’t come from Puppet Inc.

And they weren’t abandoned code dumps either. They were alive. Maintained. Evolving. A real, breathing community.

Over the years, I contributed small PRs here and there. I’m not the biggest developer in the room, but I love structure. I love planning. I love organizing chaos into something useful. Helping people build better things together is what drives me.

Recently, I’ve seen more and more maintainers hand over their modules to Vox Pupuli. That matters. Keeping modules aligned to shared standards. Creating a central place where Puppet developers can collaborate. Strengthening Vox Pupuli as a home for the ecosystem. That’s something I want to actively support.

When Puppet Inc. handed over their containers, I dove straight down the rabbit hole. Those containers quickly became the OpenVox containers. From there, I started building additional CI containers I needed or believed the community could benefit from.

Including the now slightly infamous VoxBox. 😄
